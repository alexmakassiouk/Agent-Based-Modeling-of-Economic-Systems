This repository is dedicated to the exercises of the course Agent-Based Modeling of Economic Systems taught Spring 2024.

The course itself was taught by Prof. Dr. Frank Schweitzer (fschweitzer@ethz.ch), full professor for Systems Design at ETH Zurich since 2004. The exercises were organized and taught by Dr. Luca Verginer (lverginer@ethz.ch) and Dr. Giona Casiraghi (gcasiraghi@ethz.ch), both senior researchers at the chair of Systems Design. I want to thank them all and the class for a very interesting course and interesting, engaging discussions.

## Exercise content

From exercise 4 and onward, [Mesa](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa) was used as the ABM framework. It's an open-source Python library ideal for simulating complex systems.

1. Python basics
2. **Random growth models** - CLT, Bimodal mixture distribution, firm growth simulation
3. **Firm growth dynamics - Kesten model**, Simulations with target size
4. **Yule-Simon distribution**
5. **Polya Process and technology adoption** - linear and nonlinear, preference- and technology utilities, lock-in effect
6. Firm growth with interactivity - bilateral competition with firm in size proximity, transaction dynamics and resource exchange, parameter exploration
7. **Cascading processes on networks** - Capacity, loads and failing nodes, inward and outward models
8. **No exercise 8**
9. **Distance-based utility model** - undirected network. sequential edge formation as best response for maximum utility
10. **Severance costs and leading eigenvalue utility** - Introduction of severance costs to network formations.
11. **Network convergence and equilibria**
